Lost through a wormhole, spaceship destroyed, circuits fried; the Robot Space Explorer has crash-landed in the Spire and must find a way home! Gather your lost gear, gadgets, and weaponry on your way up, but keep your scanner active: the Robot Space Explorer is resourceful, and will use whatever it can get its clamps on.

The Robot Space Explorer is a playable character mod which is a collaboration with my 7-year-old son. He created about 20 card designs and card names and drew about 35 of the card arts with crayon on paper. I filled in the rest of the character design around his work and did the other half of the card arts in his style. I worked hard to make the character have simple mechanics, fun combos, and be as balanced as I could manage.

The Robot Space Explorer mod contains:
 * 77 cards
 * 11 relics
 * 3 potions

Robot Space Explorer themes:
 * Salvage keyword: return random cards from discard to your hand
 * Solar Flare keyword: stacking end-of-turn damage power that targets enemies randomly
 * Status card Static Buildup: a status card that damages and applies Weak to you at end of turn
 * Surge keyword: gain temporary Strength next turn and remove Weak
 * Exhausting attacks
 * Intentional synergies with lesser-used relics and colorless cards
